= Hop Gui Popup (Context) Dialog

The Hop Gui popup dialog is a contextual dialog that allows you to perform a lot of operations on metadata, workflows and pipelines.

The popup dialog was designed to enable fast development through search and single clicks.

The search bar at the top of the dialog enables Hop developers to

* search the available items in the dialog. The list of available items is updated as you type. Navigate to the item you need using the arrow keys and hit enter or single-click on an item to select an item or add an action or transform to your workflow or pipeline.
* collapse or expand all categories
* show categories: show the available items in a categorized list, or as one large list of items
* fixed width: display all items in a fixed with, tabular layout

== Creating Items

When you create a new item, the dialog will show you a list of metadata items that can be created with a single click of a button.

TIP: Create a new item either by clicking the image:icons/add.svg['plus' icon] in the upper left corner, through File -> New or by hitting `CTRL-N`

== Workflow Options

The 'Basic' category contains a number of operations you can perform on the current workflow.

* **edit workflow**: edit this workflow's properties: description, parameters etc.
* **create a note**: add a note to this workflow
* **paste from the clipboard**: paste actions, notes or an entire workflow from the clipboard
* **copy as workflow action**: copy this workflow to the clipboard as a workflow action, so you can paste it in another workflow as a pre-configured xref:workflow/actions/workflow.adoc[workflow] action

All other categories contain the actions you can add to your workflow.

Check the xref:workflow/actions.adoc[full list] of actions for detailed information on the available action options.

== Pipeline Options

The 'Basic' category contains a number of operations you can perform on the current pipeline.

* **edit pipeline**: edit this pipeline's properties: description, parameters etc.
* **create**: add a note to this pipeline
* **paste from the clipboard**: paste transforms, notes or an entire pipeline from the clipboard
* **copy as pipeline action**: copy this pipeline to the clipboard as a workflow action, so you can paste it in a workflow as a pre-configured xref:workflow/actions/pipeline.adoc[pipeline] action

== Hop Options

The Hop options, available from both the workflow and pipeline editors, offer a number of operations you can perform on one or more hops.

For pipelines, the dialog offers the following options:

* Basic
** **disable/enable hop**: enable the current hop (if disabled) or disable the current hop (if enabled). This option will only show the applicable options (e.g. 'enable hop' won't be shown for active hops and vice versa)
** **delete hop**: delete the current hop
* Bulk
** **Enable downstream hops**: enable the current hop, and all hops that follow later in the workflow (or pipeline).
** **Disable downstream hops**: disable the current hop and all hops that follow later in the current workflow (or pipeline).

When working in a workflow, the hops popup dialog has all the options as the pipeline hop dialog, with one additional category:

* Routing
** **Unconditional hop**: make the current hop unconditional (ignore the result of the previous action and follow this hop anyway)
** **Success hop**: make the current hop a success hop (only follow if the result of the previous action is 'success')
** **Failure hop**: make the current hop a failure hop (only follow if the result of the previous action is 'failure')
