:description: Hop Web is a browser based alternative for desktop Hop Gui. Hop Web offers exactly the same functionality as the desktop client, you'll hardly notice any difference.

= Hop Web

Hop Web is a web based Hop Gui version.
Hop Gui was designed from the ground up to be web-ready. You'll barely notice any difference between working in the Hop Gui _fat client_ or Hop Web.

== Getting Hop Web

Hop Web is included in the default Hop build.
With each build, an update is pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/hop-web[Docker Hub].

This continously updated docker image is by far the easiest way to try out Hop Web:

Pull the latest build with: `docker pull apache/hop-web`.

Once the image has been pulled, start Hop Web with `docker run -p 8080:8080 apache/hop-web:latest`

The Hop Web container should only take a couple of seconds to start.
Your container logs should output similar to the example below:

[source,bash]
----
22-Apr-2021 18:13:39.786 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDirectory Deployment of web application directory [/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT] has finished in [8,274] ms
22-Apr-2021 18:13:39.790 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-nio-8080"]
22-Apr-2021 18:13:39.797 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in [8319] milliseconds
2021/04/22 18:14:37 - Hop - Projects enabled
2021/04/22 18:14:37 - Hop - Enabling project : 'default'
----

Once your container has started, Hop Web is available at http://localhost:8080/ui.
You'll feel right at home!

== Starting Hop Web with a project and environment

Hop Web accepts the same variables as the default Apache Hop container image to allow Hop Web users to specify their project and environment when starting a Hop Web container:

|===
|Environment Variable|Description

|```HOP_PROJECT_NAME```
| Name of the Hop project to create in the container.
You also need to specify the ```HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER``` variable.
If you do not set this variable, no project or environment will be created.

|```HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER```
| Path to the home of the Hop project.

|```HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME```
| The name of the Hop environment to create in the container.
If you do not set this variable, no environment will be created.
When using an environment a project has to be created too

|```HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS```
| This is a comma separated list of paths to environment config files (including filename and file extension).

|===

Example `docker run` command to start Hop Web with a project and environment:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -it --rm \
  --env HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER=/project \
  --env HOP_PROJECT_NAME=web-samples \
  --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=web-samples-test \
  --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS=/config/web-samples-test.json \
  --name hop-web-test-container \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v <PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT>:/project \
  -v <PATH_TO_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT>:/config \
  hop-web
----

== Using the Hop CLI tools in Hop Web.

Hop Web contains the default xref:hop-tools/index.adoc[Hop tools] like xref:hop-tools/hop-conf/hop-conf.adoc[hop-conf], xref:hop-run/index.adoc[hop-run] etc.

The tools are available in `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` in a running Hop Web container.
