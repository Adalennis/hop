You can specify an environment or a project when executing a pipeline or a workflow.
By doing so you are automatically configuring metadata, variables without too much fuss.

The easiest example is shown by executing the "complex" pipeline from the Apache Beam examples:

[source,bash]

2022/12/15 14:40:55 - General - Executing this pipeline using the Beam Pipeline Engine with run configuration 'Direct'
----

To execute an Apache Beam pipeline a lot of information and metadata is needed.
Let's dive into a few fun information tidbits:

* By referencing the ```samples``` project Hop knows where the project is located (```config/projects/samples```)
* Since we know the location of the project, we can specify pipelines and workflows with a relative path
* The project knows where its metadata is stored (```config/projects/samples/metadata```) so it knows where to find the ```Direct``` pipeline run configuration (```config/projects/samples/metadata/pipeline-run-configuration/Direct.json```)
* This run configuration defines its own pipeline engine specific variables, in this case the output folder : ```DATA_OUTPUT={openvar}PROJECT_HOME{closevar}/beam/output/```
* The output of the samples is as such written to ```config/projects/samples/beam/output```

To reference an environment you can execute using ```-e``` or ```--environment```.
The only difference is that you'll have a number of extra environment variables set while executing.
