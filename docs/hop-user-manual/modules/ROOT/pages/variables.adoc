[[Variables]]
:imagesdir: ../assets/images
:openvar: ${
:closevar: }
:description: Well-designed Hop solutions never use hard coded values. Hop offers variables on the global, project and environment levels, and allows workflows and parameters to provide parameters, to set and read variables in runtime etc.

= Variables

== What is a Hop variable?

You don't want to hardcode your solutions.
It's simply bad form to hardcode host names, user names, passwords, directories and so on.
Variables allow your solutions to adapt to a changing environment.
If for example the database server is different when developing than it is when running in production, you set it as a variable.

== How do I use a variable?

In the Hop user interface all places where you can enter a variable have a '$' symbol to the right of the input field:

image::variable-indicator.png[The variable indicatorm, width="65%"]

You can specify a variable by referencing it between an opening `{openvar}` and a closing `{closevar}`.

[source]
${VARIABLE_NAME}

Please note that in the case of a textvar (a text field that supports variables), you don't *have* to specify a variable in these places. You can enter hard-coded values (although we advise to use variables where possible).

Combinations of a variable with other free-form text are also possible, like in the example below:

[source]
${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/input/source-file.txt


// CTRL-space snippet
include::snippets/variables/control-space.adoc[]


== Hexadecimal values

In rare cases you might have a need to enter non-character values as separators in 'binary' text files with for example a zero byte as a separator.
In those scenarios you can use a special 'variable' format:

[source]
$[<hexadecimal value>]

A few examples:

|===
|Value |Meaning

|`$[00]`
|A single byte with decimal value 0

|`$[FFFF]`
|Two bytes with decimal value 65535

|`$[CEA3]`
|The 2 bytes representing UTF-8 character Σ

|`$[e28ca8]`
|The 3 bytes representing UTF-8 character ⌨

|`$[f09d849e]`
|The 4 bytes representing UTF-8 character 𝄞
|===

== How can I define variables?

Variables can be defined and set in all the places where it makes sense:

* in hop-config.json when it applies to the installation
* in an environment configuration file when it concerns a specific lifecycle environment
* In a xref:projects/projects-environments.adoc[project]
* In a xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/pipeline-run-configurations.adoc[pipeline run configuration]
* As a default parameter value in a pipeline or workflow
* Using the xref:pipeline/transforms/setvariable.adoc[Set Variables] transform in a pipeline
* Using the xref:workflow/actions/setvariables.adoc[Set Variables] action in a workflow
* When executing with xref:hop-run/index.adoc[Hop run]

== Locality

Variables are local to the place where they are defined.

This means that setting them in a certain place means that it's going to be inherited from that place on.

This also means that's important to know where variables can be set and used and the hierarchy behind it.

== Hierarchy

.Variables Hierarchy
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Place|Inheritance
|System properties|Inherited by the JVM and all other places in Hop
|Environment|Inherited by run configurations
|Run Configurations|Pipeline run configurations are inherited by the environment
|Pipeline|Inherited by the pipeline run configuration
|Workflow|Inherited by the workflow run configuration
|Metadata objects|Inherited by the place where it is loaded
|===

== Parameters

Pipeline and workflows can (optionally) accept parameters.

Workflow and pipeline parameters are similar, and are a special type of variable that is only available within the current workflow or pipeline.

Workflow and pipeline parameters can have a default value and a description, and can be passed on from workflows and pipelines to other workflows and pipelines through a variety of workflow actions and pipeline transforms.

=== System properties

All system properties are variables that are available in all of your currently running Apache Hop instance. System properties are available as variables as well as all Java system properties.

System properties get set in the Java Virtual Machine that runs your Apache Hop instance. This means that you should limit yourself to only those variables which are really system specific.

You can define new system properties in the Hop GUI using the system properties editor (using the menu bar or the Hop icon menu):

image::system-properties-menu.png[The system properties menu in Hop GUI, width="65%"]

These variables will be written to the `hop-config.json` file in your hop installation's `config` folder or in your `{openvar}HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER{closevar}` location.

[source,json]
{
  "systemProperties" : {
    "MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY" : "SomeValue"
  }
}

CAUTION: even though you _can_ manually change the `hop-config.json` or any of the other configuration files, you'll rarely, if ever, need to. Only change `hop-config.json` manually if you know what you're doing.

You can also use the hop-config command line tool to define system properties:

[source,bash]
sh hop-config.sh -s MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY=SomeValue



=== Environment Variables

You can specify variables in xref:projects/index.adoc[project lifecycle environments] as well.

This helps you configure folders and other things which are environment specific, and lets you keep a clean separation between code (your project) and configuration (your environment).

You can set those in the xref:projects/projects-environments.adoc#_create_an_environment[environment settings dialog] or using the command line:

[source,bash]
sh hop-config.sh -e MyEnvironment -em -ev VARIABLE1=value1

=== Run Configurations

You can specify variables in xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/pipeline-run-configurations.adoc[pipeline run configurations] and xref:workflow/workflow-run-configurations/workflow-run-configurations.adoc[workflow run configurations] to make a pipeline or workflow run in an engine agnostic way.

For example, you can have the same pipeline run on Hadoop with Spark and specify an input directory using `hdfs://` and on Google DataFlow using `gs://`

=== Workflow

You can define variables in a workflow either with the xref:workflow/actions/setvariables.adoc[Set Variables], xref:workflow/actions/eval.adoc[JavaScript] actions or by using parameters.

=== Pipelines

You can define variables in a pipeline either with the xref:pipeline/transforms/setvariable.adoc[Set Variables], xref:pipeline/transforms/javascript.adoc[JavaScript] transforms or by defining parameters.

*IMPORTANT* As mentioned in the xref:pipeline/transforms/setvariable.adoc[Set Variables] documentation page, you can't set and use variables in the same pipeline, since all transforms in a pipeline run in parallel.

== Available global variables

The following variables are available in Hop through the xref:hop-gui/perspective-configuration.adoc[configuration perspective]. If you have the menu toolbar enabled in the configuration perspective's xref:hop-gui/perspective-configuration.adoc#_general[General] tab, these variables are also available through `Tools -> Edit config variables`.

If this setting is set to "Y", an string starting with digits will be converted successfully into a number. (example: 192.168.1.1 will be converted into 192 or 192.168 or 192168 depending on the decimal and grouping symbol).
The default (N) will be to throw an error if non-numeric symbols are found in the string.

|HOP_PLUGIN_CLASSES||A comma delimited list of classes to scan for plugin annotations
|HOP_ROWSET_GET_TIMEOUT|50|The name of the variable that optionally contains an alternative rowset get timeout (in ms).
This only makes a difference for extremely short lived pipelines.
